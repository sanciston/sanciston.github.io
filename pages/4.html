        <h1> Number 4 </h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>16/08/2025</i></h3>
        <p>I live near Island Bay, which is normally a nice place to live, unless you want to get to Mirimar, because you have to go through town, so
        I had to bike to the start of the 4, in Strathmore Park, which would normally be fine, except for the fact that google maps can not tell the
        difference between stairs and path, so, I had to lug my bike up what felt like at least 200 or 300 meters of stairs.</p>
        <p>Anyways, once I got the start, I met with my friend Marlon, who I had to apologize to for being late, and we continued walking to his house,
        where I stashed my bike. We had some interesting conversations.
        </p>
        <p>Once we got to town it became apparent that this was a bad time to be there, as there was a <i>massive</i> protest going on that day,
        that was going a similar route to us. While this was happening we stopped at The Oaks Satay Noodle House, which if you don't know, is one of those
        Asian food places that look as if it would be terrible, but have the most delicious and cheap food you can get. This place is in the most off the
        main path location up some tiny staircase on cuba street, yet somehow it's managed to stay alive for 20+ years. The power of good food I guess.
        Continuing along the path, we had to wade through the stream of protesters, although it cleared up once we reached Wellington station, where we
        turned off towards Kelburn and Newlands.
        </p>
        <p>Once we got to Kelburn I decided my goal would be to take photos of kākā, which I tried and failed at multiple times. While we were walking I did
        get to see and photograph some kererū (see second to last photo), which made my day. Once we got near to the end of the route in Wilton, I
        did manage to see and photograph some kākā (see last photo), which again made my day, as it makes me incredibly happy to know that they are growing
        in population.
